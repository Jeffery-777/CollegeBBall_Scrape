# CollegeBBall_Scrape
Used for article on chances of D1 players making the NBA

All code is in "Cleaned College Name Height Scrape" rmarkdown file. 
Go through the comments piece by piece this is not one you want to run all the way through at once on.

Much of the data saved in the code is also loaded in the repo so pay attention to that. You don't really need to invest all the time in
doing the actual scraping if you want to reproduce this. 

NOTE:
I will need to figure out lines 406 - 411 as it's locally referenced and I'm not good at global. will advise on how to fix.
